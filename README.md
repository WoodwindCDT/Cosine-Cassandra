## First off... Why?
Well, this project really is a mesh of different technologies and I just wanted to simplify some things. I really wanted to try out hosting my own database server at home and I've been developing a large application which uses vector databases, and unfortunately, most of them are pay-to-use or just plain hard to understand. So, what is this thing? I'll try to understand with you, this project is an effort to provide an easy-to-use shell interface which will use a local Apache Cassandra DB on your machine. It currently stores your text embeddings as usual, and in 1,536 dimensions, per openai's embedding-ada-002 model. It provides the user with auto connection to their DB and user-friendly commands for upsert, query, and delete functions. In addition, I have provided a web application from the Flask framework which will display all the information and provide CRUD operations. **Good luck!**
